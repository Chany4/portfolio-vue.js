              I am very proud to say that I officially launched my small
              business at the beginning of the year, in order to help my family
              out financially and in terms of profit , I calculated the total
              profit percentage so far to 500%. I have had my challenges in
              terms buying the materials needed for my business BUT I made a way
              to receive income by being a casual at accompany called UpperEdge,
              at which I did filing work. When my product was NOT selling a I
              hoped it would at a certain stage I adapted and brought in new
              project ideas that generated an entirely new source of income.
              Having a business has shown me that I can be very adaptive,
              strategic and innovative when things do not go as expected.
